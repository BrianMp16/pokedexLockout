# New Horizons Fish Lockout
Tracker for Animal Crossing: New Horizons Fish Lockout

This is hardcoded for the 80 new horizons fish
It uses Web rtc to connect to the other person and I'm not hosting any server to find people so you have to do the handshake semi-manually.
I tried to make it easy though, basically just send the text it gives you to the other person over some sort of IM and follow the directions
